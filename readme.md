# What it's supposed to be:

* Powerpoint-like presentation for after waking up

* Horizontally split screen (in the middle) for navigating back = left, next = right

## Possible implementations: <hr>

* Combined with weekly-app so the user gets forwarded from one site to the other, after submitting the weekly-app-form

* Add icon for mobile
